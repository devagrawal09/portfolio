_Here we go... let's see what I can do!_

As I finished writing my last year in review, this is what I
told myself. In the last year in review I talked about how
crazy the year had been for me, and how I was going to use
this year to flourish. Looking back, I think I succeded!

The year started out by immediately pulling me into new
situations. I was chosen as the Conferences and Education
Chair for the ACM@UC organization, which not only meant that I
get to see how a proper organization works, but also that I
will be given responsibilities, and I'll have to work with
some new people. Being much more of a "I work alone" person,
this was a new experience, one that I was not really looking
forward to, but I'm glad I did it. Being a part of a student
organization taught me some much-needed social and management
skills. I also got an opportunity to work with some of the
best people in the organization to organize the monster of an
event called RevolutionUC. I loved being a part of this
organization, so I applied to be an executive member for the
year 2020-21. And they much have liked having me around,
because I got elected as the Webmaster! I think this is the
perfect position for me, because I get to use me skills as a
software developer to contribute to the organization.

The second situation I got thrown into was a bit more
unexpected. It was a gradual change over the course of a few
months, but I never realized how deep I got into it and how
much it had affected me, or will affect me. There are a couple
people in India who work as UC Ambassadors for all the newly
admitted Indian international students. Every year, they make
a group on Whatsapp with every person who has received an
admission offer from UC, and they also add some current
students who want to guide the incoming students and answer
any queries related to academics, campus life and such. I was
one of the students who were added. I spent a lot of time on
that group answering the hundreds of queries thrown to us,
mostly because I remember being in that position myself, and
how scary and confusing the whole experience is. What I did
not see coming was the transition from the FAQ bank to a
mentor. I did not want this change, but it happened, and
suddenly there were people looking up to me. So I tried my
best to play the role of a coach. It's not like I have the
life experience to be an effective mentor, but I believe I had
enough for that time. And it worked. I got a couple new
friends out of it, and I got to learn a lot about how to be a
good mentor. It also helps that I was taking the Introduction
to Interpersonal Communication class at that time.

An experience that was not so positive was my research
assistant job. We had some new people joining us for the ride,
and one of them was supposed to work with me on the I was
working on. For the first couple months, we worked pretty hard
on it, got a paper written and submitted to an ACM conference,
and it got accepted! That was a great motivating factor for
us, so we decided to write papers for more research venues. We
used to work long nights and weekends, because it felt like we
were onto something, and we had a great time doing it. But
some incidents made me once again realize the reason why I
always preferred working alone. There are always some people
who will push you down when you think they will pull you up,
even if it's unintentional. I still don't fully understand the
possible reasoning behind that. Maybe he wasn't committed to
the work as much as I was (or as much as I wanted him to be),
or maybe he was in over his head. Either way, the work we did
in the last couple months of 2019 was far from satisfactory,
but I learned a lot throughout the whole experience.

Things changed a lot when I started my co-op in January. I was
able to go back to my element of the software development
world. This is a world that is vast and ever-changing, and
even though I like to think that my breadth of knowledge is
pretty big, I know that it's only at the surface. My co-op,
enabled me to freely explore this exciting world and basically
explode my skillset in a matter of months. I also got to learn
a lot from my co-workers, while getting the opportunity to be
the teacher for some others.

So at the end of another crazy year, as I write this essay, I
am thinking back to what I wanted the theme of this year to
be. Looking back, I wanted to take advantage of as many
opportunities as I can, and use them to flourish. But going
into the year, I was not really sure how to. It took me some
time to get into the flow of my new life living off-campus on
my own, cooking my own food, figuring out how to travel
everyday, and managing the load of work. Figuring all this out
was the first step in the flourishing process. The next was
learning how to work with people that come in my life in the
form of peers, co-workers, teachers and mentees. The final,
and in my opinion, the most important step, was to figure out
exactly where to go from here.

Don't get me wrong; "flourish" is not the same as "grow". I
still have a lot to learn, and a lot to do. This year was a
transition from a crazy and confusing chapter to a much more
streamlined and structured chapter in the story. But to make
sure the following chapters don't get off-track, I have to put
in the work that's needed. So that's the theme I'm choosing
for the next year - **work**. As a wise man once
