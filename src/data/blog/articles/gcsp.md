    I am driven by my beliefs in passion, competency, and knowledge. I pursue these passions by utilizing my core strengths of analysis, exploration, and deliberative planning. I plan to live out these values through opportunities where I am researching and building to achieve excellence and reflection that impacts communities and technology. To do so, I will seek opportunities to use technology in new ways and change our perception of the world. When I face challenges or obstacles along the way, I will remember to stay flexible and maintain a hopeful outlook.

The world is run on ideas and beliefs. Our ideas point the way
to go, and our beliefs guide us throughout the journey. This
journey, called “life”, is a long and complicated one, and is
full of not only obstacles, but twists and loops which can
bring even the most prepared travelers to their submission.
The key to a successful journey is to stick to the most basic
virtues of your life, which are your ideas and your beliefs.
Or at least, this is the popular opinion.

What people don’t realize is that sometimes, you cannot stick
to your ideas while holding on to your beliefs. This conflict
has a way of making the strongest people enter existential
crisis. Think about it yourself – would you hold on to a set
of beliefs you have gathered over your life that define who
you are as an individual? Or can you sacrifice your beliefs
for an idea that could potentially change you and your life,
and something that does a greater good to the community?

It might seem easy to theorize that you can always stick to
your beliefs and still work on your ideas. But believe me,
everyone faces this conflict at least once in their lifetime.
Most people spend their lifetime trying to figure out what to
stick to. And the strongest people are the ones who want to
work on their best ideas as much as they want to hold on to
their beliefs, and are therefore hit the worst when they have
to choose one.

I have been fortunate enough to face this conflict early on in
my life, when making the choice could not have devastated me.
I chose to run towards my ideas, work on my future, and serve
the greater good, even if it meant sacrificing what I believe
in. I am not suggesting in any way that choosing ideas over
beliefs is the right thing to do. What I will suggest,
however, is that there is a “better” choice for everyone out
there. I have no idea as to how to know what it is. Mine just
came to me.

So, what is it that I have planned for myself? A social
worker? A scientist? A rockstar?

I choose 2 simple ideas to be my guide – the first is a desire
to reach greatness. It is the part of me that wants to be a
name that every person on the planet knows. Its goals are very
ambitious, even selfish sometimes. This is my primary
objective, and it helps me make long-term decisions.

But it is pretty easy to get lost and take wrong turns if you
only have such a large ambition. Which is why I have the
second idea – changing others’ lives for the better. This is a
selfless mission of bringing about a change in the community,
one that not only empowers the helpless, but also changes the
way we perceive the world around us. Often when I get lost
looking at the big picture and thinking about my ambition,
this idea of greater good tells me what to do and brings me
back on track.

How do I achieve greatness and service my community? I again
have a simple idea to stick to here – Find a way to achieve
your goals doing what you like the most. If you know that I am
majoring in Information Technology, it should come as no
surprise that I intend to use my knowledge of technology to
achieve both my goals. Knowledge is another competency that
drives my actions – an endless thirst for knowledge,
regardless of its utility. My love of learning new things
fuels my actions and accomplishments.

Reflection is also a competency that affects my decisions, and
it’s one of the major topics of interest in the Honors
program. Throughout the Gateway class, we have been encouraged
to reflect upon our activities. This is something I am fond
of, because your best teacher is your own past. Your
accomplishments teach you about your strengths and how to use
them to your advantage, and your mistakes tell you about your
weaknesses and how to overcome them. Unfortunately, a lot of
people do not realize the benefits of reflection and see it
merely as a waste of time.

These are the new set of beliefs I have adopted that will help
me realize my mission of greatness and service to the
community.
