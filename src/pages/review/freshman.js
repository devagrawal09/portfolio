                  <em>Man, what a year!</em>
                </p>
                <p>
                  This was the exact reaction I had when I saw the email from my
                  amazing Honors Advisor reminding me to write the year in
                  review. My second reaction was{" "}
                  <em>
                    "This has been such a crazy year, can I even fit it into a
                    few hundred words?"
                  </em>
                  . Regardless of the answer, I am going to try.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Which is pretty much how the last year (and a few months
                  before it) has been. I see an opportunity, I ask myself,{" "}
                  <em>
                    "Dev this is crazy, are you sure you want to do this?"
                  </em>
                  . Then I go for it. The biggest of them all was my decision to
                  spend thousands of dollars and travel thousands of miles away
                  from my family, friends and girlfriend, for college education.
                  Was it crazy? I am not even answering that question. Did it
                  pay off? Definetely!
                </p>
                <p>
                  The year started out with a lot of excitement as I was looking
                  forward to my life in a new country filled with strange people
                  and awesome opportunities. Strangely though, I did not feel
                  any anxiety or fear of living alone like I was told by others
                  who have went through the same thing. That is, until I was on
                  the plane headed for Cincy. I was completely fine, watching
                  Young Sheldon and listening to my staple death metal songs,
                  until my neighbour pulled up the map on the screen in front of
                  us that displayed the current location of the flight. At that
                  time, we were just crossing the Atlantic into east coast.
                  Looking at that hit me with a wave of anxiety like I had never
                  experienced before. That image somehow made the whole
                  experience real and scary, and all I could think about was
                  waking up in a completely strange town with no idea of what to
                  do or who to talk to. I'm still not sure when or how I
                  shrugged off that feeling. All I know that it came, made its
                  mark, left, and never came back.
                </p>

                  Continuing on the theme of crazy things that happened, the
                  craziest thing you can do to an introvert is to trap them in a
                  room with a complete stranger. I had spent most of my time
                  alone, so having a roommate was a new experience, one that I
                  was not looking forward to. But lucky for me, my roommate
                  seemed to respect my introverted nature, so we established a
                  mutually beneficial no-talk business-only relationship. Making
                  friends was never my strong suite, but I tried. Tried and
                  failed. Just like I had been doing for the last 7 years. I did
                  make a couple good friends eventually, and somehow I got
                  better at creating and managing my social life. I have a few
                  special people to thank for that.
                </p>
                <p>
                  My academic and professional life were way better than I
                  expected. I did not imagine that I would see so many
                  opportunities that I would have to think twice before starting
                  something new. So many organizations to get involved in, so
                  many projects to chime in, so many assignments to complete, so
                  many people to meet. It was crazy (no surprise there), and I
                  did not know where to start. Again, took my some time, but
                  eventually I found my way around the campus life. I got an
                  interesting job, became a core member of a student
                  organization, made nice connections and got to travel a bit.
                  University Honors helped quite a bit. From the Gateway to
                  Honors class to my first Honors experience, I learnt a lot of
                  life skills that I have now incorporated into my everyday
                  routine.
                </p>
                <p>
                  So what now? I have been asking myself that question for
                  several days now, so it's probably time I give it some serious
                  thought. Now that the crazy part is out of the way
                  (hopefully), it's time to flourish. Flourish my academic life
                  by aiming for a higher GPA (not completely satisfied with my
                  last 3.6), and flourish my professional life by making
                  expanding my skillset, connections and opportunities. Student
                  clubs are a great way to make connections, so getting involved
                  in some is definitely in my todo-list. I also need to connect
                  with some seniors and faculty members. The School of IT is an
                  awesome and student-friendly community, and I plan to make the
                  most of it.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Probably the most important thing to do is to stay open and
                  flexible. The future is unpredictable, and the more you plan,
                  the more it goes against you. So the hope is that nothing goes
                  wrong and my mission to flourish is achieved. But if I am
                  flexible enough, I can make those wrong things work in my
                  favor. This is another skill I have yet to pick up.
                </p>
