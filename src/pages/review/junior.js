                  <em>Well, that worked out great!</em>

                <p>
                  This was a year of pleasant surprises for me. Things that I
                  initially thought could be bad for me, turned out better than
                  expected.
                </p>

                <p>
                  I know this might sound weird.{" "}

                    “Isn’t 2020 supposed to be one of the worst years of our

                  </em>
                  , you might ask.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Like most questions, the answer to this one is{" "}
                  <em>“It depends”</em>. Depends on your situation, and your
                  ability to take advantage of certain circumstances.

                <p>
                  I am in no way denying that 2020 was a bad year. So many lives
                  were lost, so many families destroyed, so many jobless people
                  struggling to survive, so many people with mental health
                  issues. COVID hit India much worse, so I definitely have no
                  shortage of examples. Overall, this year sucked, and it will
                  take a hot minute for us to recover from it.
                </p>

                <p>
                  But for me personally, it was a good year. Maybe even the best
                  of my life so far. Starting right in March 2020, the pandemic
                  forced most non-essential workplaces to work remotely, right
                  around the time I was fantasizing about how great it would be
                  for me to be able to sit and home and earn money. I was kind
                  of used to working from home back in my freelance days, so it
                  didn’t take me too long to adjust. In fact, it was a nice
                  productivity boost for me.
                </p>

                <p>
                  My roommate moved out early in May, and I had to live alone
                  for the rest of the year. While I was in the search for
                  roommates, I came to enjoy living alone, and I decided that I
                  will not actively search for roommates. Especially after me
                  and my last roommate parted on bad terms. We were great
                  friends, but soon I realized that he was toxic person, and I
                  didn’t want anything pulling down my productivity.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Just like any other Indian parent, mine started to call me
                  back home for some reason. I didn’t want to go back because I
                  had a job here and I couldn’t work overseas, but I was
                  starting to miss my family and my girlfriend a little too
                  much. So, I decided to go back to India for the rest of the
                  year. I did have to give up my job for the semester, which I
                  wasn’t particularly fond of. But once I got home, I realized
                  that it was a good thing that I wasn’t allowed to work
                  overseas, because I wouldn’t have gotten enough time to do so
                  anyways. Instead, I spent my time with family, friends, and
                  girlfriend. I also started a side-project, which I am really
                  passionate about, and it’s a nice way for me to work on my
                  skills and showcase them to potential employers.
                </p>

                <p>
                  An emotional journey started for me when I went back. While I
                  absolutely loved my girlfriend, the long-distance relationship
                  was taking its toll on me. I just couldn’t see a way for me to
                  stay sane for however many years we will have to stay on
                  opposite sides of the planet. So, in early December, I broke
                  up with her. I had been mentally preparing myself for this for
                  a couple months, so it did not hit me emotionally as bad as I
                  thought. However, she was hit with an emotional truck. She had
                  a few very bad days, then some more bad days. We stopped
                  talking after a while, and I came back to the US. I might not
                  be completely over her yet, just because she was such a great
                  person and I really enjoyed being with her. It’s depressing to
                  know that life can throw such huge obstacles at you and you
                  can never get through without sacrificing something of
                  importance. You will have to make a really difficult decision,
                  and then you will spend a lot of time wondering if you made
                  the right one.
                </p>

                <p>
                  But another pleasant surprise for me was a new relationship
                  that started in late February. A couple years ago, I met this
                  great girl who is almost as ambitious as me, with a lot more
                  energy and compassion that I can ever hope to achieve. We both
                  came back to the states in January, and we started dating in
                  late February. Coming out of a 2+ years long distance
                  relationship, it is a nice change of pace to be able to
                  experience a normal relationship, one where we can actually
                  get to share a part of our lives with each other.
                </p>

                <p>
                  As soon as I came back in January, I got to continue working
                  at my last company, but on a different project. From the
                  beginning, I was told that this new project is a very
                  high-profile project, and will involve quite a bit of
                  politics, strict deadlines, high expectation, and quality
                  work. If they were trying to make me nervous and anxious,
                  mission accomplished. But after spending a few weeks on it, I
                  got a good handle of everything, and it turns out that there
                  is vast potential in this project.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Looking back at last year’s review, I set a goal of “work”.
                  And I believe that I worked hard to take good advantage of my
                  circumstances, and really propel myself in my personal and
                  professional life. Of course, the work is never going to end.
                  But I did gain quite a bit of momentum this year, thanks to
                  all the “flourishing” I was able to do.
                </p>

                <p>
                  For me, the next logical step here would probably be to
                  expand. Use the momentum I have built up to expand my reach,
                  work, skills, connections, and personality. It might seem like
                  a synonym to “flourish”, which was the theme of 2019, but in
                  my mind, the two have really different meanings. “Flourish”
                  was a phase where we transition from something very small and
                  awkward to something elegant and beautiful, like a seed
                  turning into a plant. Expansion is when the plant grows into a
                  tree, expanding its roots and branches into the environment,
                  and making its presence dominant and significant. As a wise
                  man once said,
