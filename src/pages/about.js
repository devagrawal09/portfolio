                  I am Dev Agrawal (The name 'Dev' translates to 'God', but I
                  don't let that get to my head :P ). I am a fifth-year
                  Information Technology major at the University of Cincinnati.
                  I am also a software developer, and currently I work at the UC
                  IT Solutions Center.

                <p>
                  I was introduced into this world on the 9th of May 1999, the
                  last summer of the millennium, in the beautiful and diverse
                  country of India. I was born to highly socially active
                  parents, with a large age gap between me and all of my older
                  cousins, including my brother. These factors made me a very
                  socially-awkward person. So I spent most of my life trying to
                  overcome my social anxiety, but never truly succeeded.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I got interested into the field of computer science very
                  early, when my brother introduced me to something called
                  "C++". The power of making a computer do whatever I wanted
                  through text commands felt amazing. That's when my love of
                  learning kicked in, which made me spend hours everyday
                  learning about programming and software development. School
                  was boring, so I had a lot of time to dedicate to my newfound
                  love.

                  I am a problem solver. I have always been attracted to puzzles
                  and riddles. I like how they compel you to move all the gears
                  of your brain for one purpose - search for a solution. And
                  successfully finding the solution is highly rewarding. This is
                  why I was attracted to the Information Technology program -
                  most of it is problem solving.
